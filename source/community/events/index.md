In additon to the annual Dataverse Community Meetings, the community gathers at conferences and other settings around the world to give talks and posters about the Dataverse Project or just have an informal chat. We use a [Dataverse Project Meetups](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1EQsrT0A-zBQxN9L8iJBW-7auECWvFW2qu8r-CbWrTEw/edit?usp=sharing) spreadsheet to help raise awareness of these events.
