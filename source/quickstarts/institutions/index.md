## The Harvard Dataverse Repository for your institution

Does your institution need a place to host research data but doesn't need to install the Dataverse Project software? Using the [Harvard Dataverse Repository](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/), any institution can create a customized Dataverse collection for researchers, departments, and faculty to share their research data. 

Our support team can lead trainings for you and your team virtually or in person. Need help setting up your Dataverse collection on the Harvard Dataverse Repository or want to schedule a training? Contact us at [support@dataverse.harvard.edu](mailto:support@dataverse.harvard.edu).

## Installing the Dataverse Project software

By installing the Dataverse Project software, your institution will have its own data repository with data stored at your institution as well as become a member of the Dataverse repository community. With over 65 institutions around the world currently using the Dataverse Project software as the solution to their data sharing, archiving, and publishing needs, your institution will join a community that is committed to making research data available to all. 

The Dataverse Project software is available for anyone to download in the [Dataverse GitHub repository](https://github.com/IQSS/dataverse/releases) with an in-depth [Installation Guide](http://guides.dataverse.org/en/latest/installation/index.html) to help your institution get its Dataverse repository instance up and running.
