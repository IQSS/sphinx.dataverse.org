## What is a Dataverse Collection?

Having a Dataverse collection allows you to share, organize and archive your data, while also being able to display it on your site. It ensures that you receive credit for your data through [formal scholarly data citations](http://dataverse.org/best-practices/academic-credit) and helps satisfy data sharing requirements from funders and publishers. You also have full control of your datasets, from who you share your data with and when to publish. Your web visibility is also increased since it is searchable alongside other scholars’ research data.

## How do I get started?

* View the map below to see if any of the institutions you are affiliated with have a Dataverse repository that you can deposit your data into.
* The [Harvard Dataverse Repository](https://dataverse.org/dataverse.harvard.edu/) is open to all researchers worldwide in all disciplines.

  **To deposit data with the Harvard Dataverse repository you will need to:** 

  * go to [http://dataverse.harvard.edu](http://dataverse.harvard.edu/)
  * select "[Sign Up](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataverseuser.xhtml?editMode=CREATE&redirectPage=%2Fdataverse.xhtml)" to create an account (it takes less than a minute!)
  * select "Add Data"
  * upload any type of quantitative or qualitative data (in any format)
  * when you're ready to share with others, click on "Publish" and you will get a [formal scholarly data citation](http://dataverse.org/best-practices/academic-credit).
